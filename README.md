# Interactive-Widget

With the release of iOS 17, Apple introduced a host of new features and enhancements to further empower developers in creating immersive and interactive experiences for users. One of the standout additions is the ability to create interactive widgets using SwiftUI.

I developed a simple POC that enables users to click on a shuffle button, triggering a random update of the icon image.
